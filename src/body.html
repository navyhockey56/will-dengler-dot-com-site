    Hello and welcome to my personal website. There is not too much to see here, but you are more than welcome to
    stick around and learn a bit about me, or maybe send me a message ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  <h3 class="subtitle">About Me</h3>
  <p class="content">
    About me? For the most part, I'm your typical software engineer.
    My professional experience has been focused on backend systems, with a particular focus on integrations with
    third party services. If you're interested in more details about my career, then you should head on over to my
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-dengler-a69952139/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
    Professionally, I typically work with ruby and java; although, I much prefer ruby. Writing software is
    not just my job, but also happens to be one of my favorite things to do. As such, my free time is typically
    spend tinkering on some side project - most of which you can find on my
    <a href="https://github.com/navyhockey56" target="_blank">Github</a>.

    Outside of software, I have a passion for mathematics, and I love to share this with others through
    my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3dWiQ-Ge5aiLPszvUkJXf2Zf7gAwelKD" target="_blank">Youtube videos</a>
    and website <a href="https://www.awkwardmath.com" target="_blank">Awkward Math</a>. When it comes to math, my interest
    veer towards abstract algebra, graph theory, and number theory. Like most math enthusiasts, I find prime numbers to be
    incredibly interesting and have dedicated countless hours of my life trying to understand them better. In my most recent
    expedition into understanding prime numbers, I created a state-based machine for prime number discovery which I have
    termed as "Awkward State Machines", you learn more about Awkward State Machines, and even visualize one running over on
    <a href="https://www.awkwardmath.com/awkward_state_machines#console" target="_blank">Awkward Math</a>. Outside of the
    prime numbers, I love exploring mathematics that allows me to utilize my skills as a programmer. The natural compatibility
    between the two subjects has been a strong influence on what and how I study mathematical systems. During my senior year of
    college, the synergy of the two subjects led me to develop a method for producing three, four, and five dimensional graphs
    using space and color, which I have dubbed "Color Graphs". I had the honor of presenting my methods during the poster session
    of University of Maryland's
    <a href="http://www.norbertwiener.umd.edu/FFT/2017/index.html" target="_blank">2017 February Fourier Talks</a> prior to my
    graduation that spring. I have since obtained US Patent
    <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/2e/57/aa/f288b10dfc412f/US20180293767A1.pdf" target="_blank">US20180293767A1</a>
    for the method. Today, anyone can freely create Color Graphs over on
    <a href="https://www.awkwardmath.com/colorgraphing#console" target="_blank">Awkward Math</a>.

    There's not much more to tell. Like most 20-something year olds, I love to go out with friends, and spend a bit too much time
    streaming re-runs of my favorite shows. Most of the time you'll find me in DC, feel free to drop me a message if you're in the
    area and want to grab a drink. For those of you that play, you can find me virtually on my
